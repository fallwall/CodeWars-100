// Define a method that accepts 2 strings as parameters. The method returns the first string sorted by the second.

// sortString("foos", "of")       => "oofs"

// sortString("string", "gnirts") => "gnirts"

// sortString("banana", "abn")    => "aaabnn"
// To elaborate, the second string defines the ordering. It is possible that in the second string characters repeat, so you should remove repeating characters, leaving only the first occurrence.

// Any character in the first string that does not appear in the second string should be sorted to the end of the result in original order.

function sortString(str, order ) {
  let arr = str.split(""), s = "";
  for (let o of order )
    while (arr.includes(o))
      s += arr.splice( arr.indexOf(o), 1 )[0];
  s += arr.join("");
  return s;
